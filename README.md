# Auto_MPG---Neural-Network
Using neural networks to access the features which best determine "power to weight" of cars.
Created a fill multi-layered perceptron, from scatch, which utlises the standard Gradient Descent Backpropogration algorithm.
I did not incoporate any deep-learning libaries in this application.
